// Then we'll import the compass extension

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except print and helpers) by uncommeting this line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the sections
// you want by using the this include
@include h5bp-normalize;


// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import "partials/fonts";
